# Smart Contract Will with Secret Beneficiaries

## Project Description

This project is a blockchain-based will contract that securely stores encrypted beneficiary information on-chain. The actual list of beneficiaries and their inheritance shares remain secret and encrypted, preserving privacy. Only when the owner is declared deceased, the contract allows inheritance claims.

## Project Vision

To provide a transparent yet privacy-respecting way to handle digital wills using blockchain technology. This empowers users to control their inheritance securely without publicly revealing sensitive details.

## Key Features

- Encrypted storage of beneficiary data on-chain.
- Owner-controlled update of will content.
- Ability to declare death, triggering inheritance claims.
- Funds can be securely stored and distributed.
- Privacy maintained by encrypting sensitive info off-chain.

## Future Scope

- Integration with zero-knowledge proofs for private claim verification.
- Multi-signature oracles to declare death securely.
- Automated inheritance distribution with cryptographic verification.
- User-friendly front-end for managing encrypted data and claims.
